### News
- [2024/05/10] ðŸ”¥ **LLaVA-NeXT** (Stronger) models are released, stronger LMM with support of LLama-3 (8B) and Qwen-1.5 (72B/110B). [[Blog](https://llava-vl.github.io/blog/2024-05-10-llava-next-stronger-llms/)] [[Checkpoints](https://huggingface.co/collections/lmms-lab/llava-next-6623288e2d61edba3ddbf5ff)] [[Demo](https://llava-next.lmms-lab.com/)] [[Code](https://github.com/LLaVA-VL/LLaVA-NeXT/)] 
- [2024/05/10] ðŸ”¥ **LLaVA-NeXT** (Video) is released. The image-only-trained LLaVA-NeXT model is surprisingly strong on video tasks with zero-shot modality transfer. DPO training with AI feedback on videos can yield significant improvement.

- [03/10] Releasing **LMMs-Eval**, a highly efficient evaluation pipeline we used when developing LLaVA-NeXT. It supports the evaluation of LMMs on dozens of public datasets and allows new dataset onboarding, making the dev of new LMMs much faster. [[Blog](https://lmms-lab.github.io/lmms-eval-blog/lmms-eval-0.1/)] [[Codebase](https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/lmms-eval)]
- [1/30] ðŸ”¥ **LLaVA-NeXT** (LLaVA-1.6) is out! With additional scaling to LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-NeXT-34B outperforms Gemini Pro on some benchmarks. It can now process 4x more pixels and perform more tasks/applications than before. Check out the [blog post](https://llava-vl.github.io/blog/2024-01-30-llava-next/), and explore the [demo](https://llava.hliu.cc/)! Models are available in [Model Zoo](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA/blob/main/docs/MODEL_ZOO.md). Training/eval data and scripts coming soon.
- [11/10] [LLaVA-Plus](https://llava-vl.github.io/llava-plus/) is released: Learning to Use Tools for Creating Multimodal Agents, with LLaVA-Plus (LLaVA that Plug and Learn to Use Skills).

- [10/26] ðŸ”¥ LLaVA-1.5 with LoRA achieves comparable performance as full-model finetuning, with a reduced GPU RAM requirement ([ckpts](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA/blob/main/docs/MODEL_ZOO.md#llava-v15), [script](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA#train)). We also provide a [doc](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA/blob/main/docs/Finetune_Custom_Data.md) on how to finetune LLaVA-1.5 on your own dataset with LoRA.
- [10/12] Check out the Korean LLaVA (Ko-LLaVA), created by ETRI, who has generously supported our research! [[ðŸ¤— Demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/etri-vilab/Ko-LLaVA)]
- [10/5] ðŸ”¥ LLaVA-1.5 is out! Achieving SoTA on 11 benchmarks, with just simple modifications to the original LLaVA, utilizes all public data, completes training in ~1 day on a single 8-A100 node, and surpasses methods like Qwen-VL-Chat that use billion-scale data. Check out the [technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03744), and explore the [demo](https://llava.hliu.cc/)! Models are available in [Model Zoo](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA/blob/main/docs/MODEL_ZOO.md). The training data and scripts of LLaVA-1.5 are released [here](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA#train), and evaluation scripts are released [here](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA/blob/main/docs/Evaluation.md)!
- [9/26] LLaVA is improved with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to improve fact grounding and reduce hallucination. Check out the new SFT and RLHF checkpoints at project [[LLavA-RLHF]](https://llava-rlhf.github.io/)
- [9/22] [LLaVA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08485) is accepted by NeurIPS 2023 as **oral presentation**, and [LLaVA-Med](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00890) is accepted by NeurIPS 2023 Datasets and Benchmarks Track as **spotlight presentation**.
