## CogVLM2

###  TL;DR
We launch a new generation of **CogVLM2** series of models and open source two models based
on [Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct). Compared with the previous
generation of CogVLM open source models, the CogVLM2 series of open source models have the following improvements:

1. Significant improvements in many benchmarks such as `TextVQA`, `DocVQA`.
2. Support **8K** content length.
3. Support image resolution up to **1344 * 1344**.
4. Provide an open source model version that supports both **Chinese and English**.
