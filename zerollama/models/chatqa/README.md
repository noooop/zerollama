# ChatQA

## TL;DR
We introduce Llama3-ChatQA-1.5, which excels at conversational question answering (QA) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Llama3-ChatQA-1.5 is developed using an improved training recipe from [ChatQA paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.10225), and it is built on top of [Llama-3 base model](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B). Specifically, we incorporate more conversational QA data to enhance its tabular and arithmetic calculation capability. Llama3-ChatQA-1.5 has two variants: Llama3-ChatQA-1.5-8B and Llama3-ChatQA-1.5-70B. Both models were originally trained using [Megatron-LM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM), we converted the checkpoints to Hugging Face format. **For more information about ChatQA, check the [website](https://chatqa-project.github.io/)!**
