# Surya

# TL;DR
Surya is a document OCR toolkit that does:

- OCR in 90+ languages that benchmarks favorably vs cloud services
- Line-level text detection in any language
- Layout analysis (table, image, header, etc detection)
- Reading order detection

# Commercial usage

I want surya to be as widely accessible as possible, while still funding my development/training costs. Research and personal usage is always okay, but there are some restrictions on commercial usage.

The weights for the models are licensed `cc-by-nc-sa-4.0`, but I will waive that for any organization under $5M USD in gross revenue in the most recent 12-month period AND under $5M in lifetime VC/angel funding raised. If you want to remove the GPL license requirements (dual-license) and/or use the weights commercially over the revenue limit, check out the options [here](https://www.datalab.to).
